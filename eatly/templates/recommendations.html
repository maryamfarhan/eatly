    <h4>🍴 #1: Air-Fried Parmesan “Frico” Cups with Italian Beef Crumble</h4>

    <div class="feature-recipe">
        <p class="tagline">
            Cozy, crunchy cheese shells + warm, herby beef — lots of salty comfort,
            Italian flavor, zero fresh veg.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why it fits: parmesan/cheese crisps cook in the air fryer in ~4–6 minutes
            and make a low-fiber crunchy base; Ground beef seasoned Italian-style
            gives the salty, savory center. (Air-fryer frico/parmesan crisp methods
            shown in multiple quick recipes.)
        </p>

        <h5>🕮 Recipe (~15–18 minutes):</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat air fryer to 400°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>
                Drain/season beef: break 8 oz ground beef into small pieces, season with
                ½ tsp salt, ½ tsp dried oregano, ¼ tsp dried basil, and 1 tsp
                garlic-infused oil (safe for low-FODMAP). (If you don’t have
                garlic-infused oil, omit — still tasty.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook beef: place beef in a shallow, air-fryer-safe dish or a small sheet
                and air-fry 6–8 minutes, stirring halfway, until browned and crumbly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make parmesan cups: grate ~2 tbsp Parmesan (or other hard cheese) per
                cup. Place tablespoons of cheese in the cups of a small metal muffin tin
                (or form small mounds on parchment). Air-fry 4–6 minutes at 400°F until
                edges are golden and crisp; let cool 1–2 minutes to set.
            </li>
            <li>
                Assemble: Spoon warm beef into each cheese cup. Optionally finish with a
                tiny drizzle of garlic-infused oil and a pinch of extra Parm. Serve
                immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
    <p>
      Optional mini shopping list / adds (all low-FODMAP friendly): Parmesan,
      garlic-infused olive oil, dried basil/oregano. 
    </p>
    <p>
     Substitutes: If you don’t have Parmesan, use any hard melting cheese 
     (cheddar will crisp though texture changes).

    <h4>🍴 #2: “Cracker RITZ-wich” — Warm Italian Beef & Melted Cheese Stack (cracker-based melt)</h4>

    <div class="feature-recipe">
        <p class="tagline">
            A nostalgic, salty stack: crackers topped with warm seasoned beef and melted cheese—ready 
            in ~10 minutes. Close to classic cracker-melt appetizers (many cracker + meat + cheese recipes exist).
        </p>
        <p>
            Linked recipe inspiration: SnackWorks “Roast Beef ’n Cheddar RITZwich” shows the exact cracker + meat + cheese 
            approach—adapt it to low-FODMAP seasoning and your beef.
        </p>

        <h5>🕮 Recipe (5–12 minutes):</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat air fryer to 350–375°F.</li>
            <li>
                Break or thinly slice leftover roast or quickly brown 6–8 oz ground 
                beef in the air fryer for ~6 minutes (or pan). Season with salt, ¼ tsp 
                dried oregano, ¼ tsp rosemary, and 1 tsp garlic-infused oil (or omit).
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange crackers in a single layer on an air-fryer tray or parchment. 
                Top each cracker with a small mound of warm beef and a slice/shred of cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Air-fry 3–5 minutes at 350°F until cheese melts and edges of crackers are warm/crisp. 
                Serve stacked (cheese-meat-cracker) or open-faced.
            </li>
        </ol>
    <p>
        Tiny shopping list if you want to “Italianize”: high-quality cheddar or provolone, 
        horseradish cream (optional — check FODMAP), or a jarred, low-FODMAP olive tapenade 
        (check labels).
    </p>
    <p>
     Notes: Keep flavors mild and avoid spicy condiments. The SnackWorks recipe is a 
     handy published template to mirror.

    <h4>🍴 #3: Air-Fryer Italian Beef Meatballs over Crushed Crackers (Low-FODMAP meatballs)</h4>

    <div class="feature-recipe">
        <p class="tagline">
            Warm, salty, herbaceous meatballs — melt cheese over them and serve over crushed crackers 
            for crunch. Uses classic low-FODMAP meatball structure (gluten-free crumbs or fine cracker crumbs, egg, Parmesan).
        </p>
        <p>
            Linked inspiration: Low-FODMAP Italian meatball recipes and low-FODMAP meatball-in-sauce 
            templates exist and show use of garlic-infused oil and Parmesan for flavor. Use those seasoning ideas but skip fresh veg.
        </p>

        <h5>🕮 Recipe (20 minutes):</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat air fryer to 390°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>
                Mix meatball base: In a bowl combine 1 lb ground beef (or 8–10 oz for a single meal), 
                ¼ cup finely crushed low-FODMAP crackers or gluten-free breadcrumbs, 
                1 large egg (or ½ egg beaten), ¼ cup grated Parmesan, 1 tsp dried oregano, 
                ½ tsp salt, 2 tsp garlic-infused oil. Mix until just combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Form small meatballs (about 1–1.5 in).
            </li>
            <li>
                Air-fry meatballs on a tray 8–10 minutes at 390°F, shaking halfway, 
                until browned and cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Optional: top each hot meatball with a pinch of shredded mozzarella/Provolone 
                and air-fry 1 more minute to melt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve over a bowl of lightly crushed crackers to absorb juices and add crunch.
            </li>
        </ol>
    <p>
        Optional extras / shopping list: lactose-free cheese or Parmesan (if dairy-sensitive), 
        gluten-free cracker crumbs. Use garlic-infused oil for garlic flavor without FODMAPs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Notes: Keep flavors mild and avoid spicy condiments. The SnackWorks recipe is a 
     handy published template to mirror.

  <h2>
    Dietary Preference Notes
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Use garlic-infused oil for garlic flavor without the FODMAPs—multiple low-FODMAP recipes 
        use this as the standard replacement. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid fresh onion/garlic pieces, high-fiber veg, and high-fructose fruit (you already noted no fresh veg/fruit). 
        The linked low-FODMAP recipes model safe swaps.
    </li>
  </ul>
